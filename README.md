# LLM code assistant experiments

This repository contains the code described in our blog post, [How effective are AI tools for writing D3 code?](https://observablehq.com/blog/ai-tools-llms-d3-code)

It contains D3 code created by [Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.7 LLM](https://claude.ai/).

To see the files locally, clone or download this repo and then run a local webserver. On macOS and Linux, you probably have Python installed, and can use this command:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 9000
```

The files will then be visble at [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/).
